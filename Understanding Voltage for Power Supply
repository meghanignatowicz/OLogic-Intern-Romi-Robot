Understanding Voltage for Power Supply

  Ohm's Law 
    V=IR
   V = voltage
   I = Current
   R = resistance
   
Voltage of LED:
 5 volts = IR
 3.3 volts for LED
 5-3.3 = 1.7 = necessary volts
 
 [1A for every 1000mA]
 current test = 15 mA = 0.015 A
 1.7/0.015 = 113.333 = I
 
Vcc = voltage at the common collector
V = supply voltage
cc = supply voltage is postive or negative

AC = analog - natural rythm 
            - signals power/data/wifi: wireless
            - delivery of current in long distances = AC
DC = digital - 0's and 1's
             - low level power 
Ie. MOSFETS: transistor(switch)
    hold states of 1 or 0, transfers logic between 1's and 0's
AC ardiuno - relies on 1's and 0's
           - uses DC because it needs binary
           - computation --> DC
         Ie. remote: DC --> AC
             fm/am radio: frequency/amplitude/modulation
Minimize AC signaling --> DC
Ie. AC wall plug --> lamp --> coil inductor is open in AC --> coil get hot --> creates light
              |--> LED - diode = AC signal --> current switch mode power supply --> AC > DC logic produce efficient energy --> light is cold (lumens)

Electron flow = friction

Current increases --> volume of electrons increases --> friction increases --> temoerature increases: enegery lost

Power = IV

Diodes
  Rectification: process of taking AC signal and cutting off 1/2 voltage 
                                                              |--> positive/negative
  needs rectification: AC > DC 
                        |--> current > static
  Rectification currents: diodes cancel out waveform/ 120V AC > 120V DC
  
  LED --> Band gap
  Transformer --> purpose magnetic isolation
  
  Parallel vs. Series
  ++
  --
  vs
  +-+-
   Parallel:
    - increases capacity
      Ie. 1.5V
          500mA(2) = 1000mA
    Series:
      - increases voltage
        Ie. 1.5V(2) = 3V
    
   Resistors: 
    Parallel: resistors in parallel = half their value 
            - 10ohm parallel with 10ohm = (R1)(R2)/(R1+R2) = 100/20 = 5ohms
    Series: current through each resistor in series is the same/ current is the same at all points in a series circuit 
            - 50ohm series with 30ohm = R1+R2 = 80ohm
